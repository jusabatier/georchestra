[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/grade/a879ac64588d4357ab72e79cd8026f99)](https://www.codacy.com/app/francois-vanderbiest/georchestra)

geOrchestra is a complete **Spatial Data Infrastructure** solution.

It features a **metadata catalog** (GeoNetwork 3.0.4), an **OGC server** (GeoServer 2.8.3 and GeoWebCache 1.8.1) with fine-grained access control (based on GeoFence), an **advanced viewer and editor**, an **extractor** and **many more** (security and auth system based on proxy/CAS/LDAP, analytics, admin UIs, ...)


## Releases

A new release is published every 6 months and is supported during 12 months. 
Stable versions are named by their release date, eg 15.12 (latest stable) was published in december 2015.  

Have a look at the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for more information.


## Install

Depending on your goals and skills, there are several ways to install geOrchestra:

 * a [docker composition](docker-compose.yml), which pulls pre-built images from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/georchestra/), is perfect for demo purposes. Provided you have a good download speed and recent machine (8Gb required), you'll be up and running on `localhost:8080` within 10 minutes after `docker-compose up`.
 * a contributed [ansible playbook](https://github.com/georchestra/ansible) allows you to spin an instance in a few minutes. This is probably the easiest way to create a small production server, since it takes care of installing the middleware, fetching the webapps and configuring them.
 * generic [debian (or yum) packages](https://build.georchestra.org/) are perfect to create complex architectures, but you'll have to [install and configure the middleware](doc/setup.md) first.
 * you could also use the [generic wars](http://build.georchestra.org/wars/) with their "[datadir](https://github.com/georchestra/datadir)", as an alternate method. The above packages provide both.
 * finally, [building from the sources](doc/build.md) is the most flexible solution, since it allows you to customize the webapps very deeply. You get custom WAR files, packages or docker images that you can [deploy](doc/deploy.md) to dev, test, or production servers. 


If you opt for the middleware setup by yourself, there are several [optimizations](doc/optimizations.md), [good practices](doc/good_practices.md) and [tutorials](doc/tutorials.md) that are worth reading. 
Note that the minimum system requirement is 2 cores and 4Gb RAM, but we recommend at least 4 cores and 8 Gb RAM for a production instance.
More RAM is of course better !
